Workout 02 for Stat 133- building a shiny app for visualizing three modes of investing. 

Created a shiny app using tools and skills learned in UCB Stat 133 with professor Gaston Sanchez. 

Using code from warmup 6, created a shiny app to demonstrate changes in returns using three modes of investing: no_contrib meaning no initial contribution, fixed_contrib meaning constant rate of return, and growing_contrib with an additional growth rate.
